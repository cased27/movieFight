# movieFight

This is a code-along app to work on many aspects of what I have been learning. You should be able to type in any 2 movie titles into the two search fields as if to 'battle' them (like the cardgame 'war'). The differences should be highlighted in different colors.

## This project focuses on:

* Async Functions (and await)
* Organizing code / breaking code up in different documents
* Refactoring code to be as reusable as possible
* accessing databases and connecting pages and databases together
* How to utilized different libraries and databases to your advantage.

Initially I have understood the overall concepts being used and discussed. However there are a few things I would like to continue to work on:

* The purpose/ use of Async Funcs - and how to use them properly (and why/when you would use one)
* Refactoring to make your code as reusable as possible
